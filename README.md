# SkeletalRetargetingEditor
WIP user-friendly editor for modifying the retargeting settings of cooked skeletal assets from UE4/UE5 games. Current code is only compatible with assets from non-IO Store UE5.1 titles, and is only tested on Palworld. Likely unstable and not recommended for usage without further commits.
